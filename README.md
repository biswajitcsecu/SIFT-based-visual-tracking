# SIFT-based-visual-tracking
This code impliments a robust and faster visual tracking framework using shift-invariant features (SIF) and the optical flow in belief- propa- gation (BF) algorithm for efficient processing in real scenarios. SIFT with BF algorithm build invariant features to correspond the regions of interest across frames.
